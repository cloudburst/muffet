# Credits

The code borrows heavily from the Udemy [node.js tutorial](https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/) and the book [Web Development with MongoDB and Node.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-development-mongodb-and-nodejs).

The name was inspired by the best character in [Undertale](http://undertale.com/).
